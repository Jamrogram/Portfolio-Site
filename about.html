         Jamie Graham is a nonbinary artist, animator, and creative content maker born and raised in the San Fernando Valley in sunny, dry, Southern California. 
         They spent an often difficult and complicted childhood escaping into what nature surrounded them and that appreciation for the perseverence and adaptability of life informs their work and values to this day. 
         Jam tries to use their work to support community, sustainability, social activism, and education, and you can often find them investing hours into researching for projects just for the joy of learning. 
         Jam is currently lucky to be spending their 3rd year at Calarts in the Character animation program and will be graduating in 2021. 
         If you catch them getting coffee, please talk to them about your favorite animal or rock, they love that shit

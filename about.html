       Jam spent an often difficult and complicted childhood avoiding home by exploring what environments surrounded them. The appreciation for the perseverence and adaptability of wildlife, things bigger than the individual, and the quirky & diverse bustle of humanity in Los Angeles informs their work and values to this day. 
         Jam uses art to aim to support community, sustainability, resource sharing, social activism, and education, and their practice uses a variety of techniques and materials.

         Jam is currently lucky to be spending their 3rd year at Calarts in the Character animation program and will be graduating in 2021. They are a furvent animal lover and live at the edges of the LA sprawl with a studio practice with a patient and sarcastic Jindo-BorderCollie mix named Salem.
         You will likely find Jam hiking or coffee-loading, and if spotted, please feel free talk to them about your favorite animal or rock, they love that shit. </p>
